# NumericalMethods

Implementation of some numerical methods for laboratory work at the University

> Nonlinear equation
> * bisection
> * relaxation
> * newton

>System of Nonlinear equation
> * newton

> Integral
> * rectangle, trapezoid, simpson

>Interpolation
> * cubic spline


Note:
- 2d vectors are used for matrices. 
    - The Euclidean norm for vectors. 
    - Forward differences for calculating the Jacobi matrix.
- Criterion for stopping all iterative methods: $$|x_k - x_{k-1}|$$
- Runge rule for integration
